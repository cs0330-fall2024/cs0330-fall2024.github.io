Instructions For Modifying 33 Website

Staff pictures need to be in the img/people folder in .jpg format and must
be called <ta-login>.jpg.

Each staff member's div must be updated manually to make the id
the staff member's login, and the footer text reflect the actual
name and login of the TA. Finding the pictures is handled automatically,
see js/cs33.js for more details!

Lecture slides should be updated automatically, but at this point
we have to manually add the lecture videos. We also record Gear-ups.

To create a web handout, the doc should be converted to markdown and
then to html using cs0330_convert_handout. You can then copy the result into  the
body section of a copy of webhandouts.html, and put it in the appropriate course folder.
